LinkedList

I just want to show the logic and structure of the linkedlist, so that I did not extend any class and implement any interfaces. 
The linked list I wrote is composed of multiple nodes, and each node have a pointer to next node and pre node. The first node and the last
node do not store the item. Since we use pointers to connect each nodes, the Linkedlists do not require contiguous memory for data storage.

In this program, I implemented add(item), remove(index),get(),and size().
